// Package go_utils provides simple Go utility packages.
//
// These are not really production quality packages, nor are they maintained or supported, they're
// simplistic mechanisms implemented to solve specific problems in code that mAdkins23 has been writing for his own use.
// If you need this functionality consider copying the code into your own project and modifying to fit your need.
