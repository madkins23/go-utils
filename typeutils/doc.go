//
// Changes in design and functionality will made to the reg package in the future.
// Applicable bugs found in reg may be fixed here as well.
// The type registry mechanism found herein will disappear in any V2 release.
// The version in the reg package should be considered authoritative.
//
// There may also be some non-registry type related functionality in this package.
// As of any V2 release this package will only contain that other non-registry functionality.
