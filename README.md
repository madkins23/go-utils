# go-utils

Common Go packages shared by other Go projects.

These are not really production quality packages, nor are they maintained or supported.
They're simplistic mechanisms implemented to solve specific problems
in code that the author has been writing for his own use.

*If you need this functionality consider copying the code into your own project and modifying to fit your need.*

See the source for documentation.

## `path`
